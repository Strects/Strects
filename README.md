# Welcome to My Profile

* Hi! I'm **Strects** on GitHub and I contribute to various repositories for Discord server operations, like my own. Most of them are private, which is why my profile may look mostly empty!

* I own a server called [Evocation](https://discord.com/invite/8XZUSks) which is focused on the genre of fantasy within speculative fiction. Our mission is to establish a community where unity converges with differing perceptions.

* This isn't related to anything at all, but here are some of my **Spotify** playlists:
  * ✨ [Survive at Midnight](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2ODPtC7eoxU3SNGs8pkDMG?si=e69e68c43ffe497d)
